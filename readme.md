## Who was Enki

> The god Ea (whose Sumerian equivalent was Enki) is one of the three most powerful gods in the Mesopotamian pantheon, along with Anu and Enlil. He resides in the ocean underneath the earth called the abzu (Akkadian apsû), which was an important place in Mesopotamian cosmic geography. For example, the city of Babylon was said to have been built on top of the abzu.

> Ea has associations with wisdom, magic and incantations. He was a favourite god amongst diviners TT  (bārû) and exorcist priests TT  (ašipū) as he is the ultimate source of all ritual knowledge used by exorcists to avert and expel evil. Ea was patron of the arts and crafts, and all other achievements of civilization. His connection with water meant that Ea was also the patron deity of cleaners (Foster 2005: 151-152).
